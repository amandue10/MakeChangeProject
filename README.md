### Make Change

### Overview

Make change is a program that works to not only provide change, but to display the bills and coins that should be returned.

### How To Use

First, you will be prompted to enter the price of the item.
Second, you will enter the amount tendered.

The program will let you know how much change will be returned.
The total change will be displayed along with a breakdown of bills
and coins to be returned.


### Technologies

Technologies used include using a while loop, if , and else if conditional statements. If statements were used to create the error message for inputing an amount less than the cost of the item and to alert the user of exact change given. The while loop was used to execute the math needed to determine amount of each bill and coin expected.

Modulus were used determine the remainders of the higher bill and coin. One lesson I learned was making sure to start coding the highest bill first. In this case it was the twenty dollar bill, followed by the ten dollar bill, followed by the five dollar bill, and so on. The same was true for the coins.

Math.floor() and Math.round() are two different functions that were used. Math.floor() helped with rounding numbers to the nearest integers. Math.round() helped when the pennies were showing one less penny returned than needed.  

### Lessons Learned

There are many concepts that I am working to grasp. My biggest take away was learning to take the time to make a plan of action, complete the tasks that I know how to complete, and then review concepts needed to make the program function. I was unsuccessful in using some concepts such as taking decimal points off of a large number. Stack overflow and youtube were a great resource and helped me see problems other programmers have had making this program. There are so many different ways to make a program.
